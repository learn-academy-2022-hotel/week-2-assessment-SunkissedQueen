# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: Developer Torin, A parameter is the placeholder for a value to be entered in a function. When that placeholder receives a value, it is known as an argument. For example const midnightSnack = () => {} is the building block code for an arrow function. The parantheses indicate the parameter. If I entered a word in there, like popcorn, I'm creating an argument (popcorn) that I can refer to to produce an output, like in a conditional statement producing "buttered" or "unbuttered" popcorn.

Researched answer: Parameters and arguments are similar, but parameters refer to the function expression by use of parantheses. Arguments are the values that get placed into the parentheses inside the function.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: From Developer Ney, value, number string

Researched answer: Required parameter, The first parameter is which function to apply to each element. The second parameter is optional and is provided with the function to be used as the this keyword.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: From Developer Raymond, The built in method .filter() is ran and it returns an array with the values that are passable through the function. The difference with .map() is that it takes whatever action is in place and applies it to each individual value in the array.

Researched answer: The difference between map and filter is that .map() will do something to each item in an array and return an array of the same length while .filter() will more so make a decision about each item in an array and return a subset based on the criteria given. For example you can use the .map() to return all the numbers in a given array as a new array with the numbers being multipled by 2. .filter() can be used when you need to return an array containing only even numbers.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: From Developer Raquel, I got string interpolation confused with iteration until my breakout room partner corrected me.

Researched answer:
Iterable objects are objects that can be iterated over with for...Of.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer:From Developer Molly, Classes are recipes for making objects. They contain data and action. Objects are non-primitiure, meaning they are a collection of things. A base structure for an object are key value pairs.

Researched answer: The difference between a class an object is a class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: From Developer Chris, Hoisting is the act of moving classes, variables and functions above the code that is performing a call on them.

Researched answer: Hoisting is the process of moving the declarations of functions, variables and/or classes above their scope, so that they are declared before they are called on to be executed.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: informational description in the point of view of the user

2. Spread operator: ..., allows an array to be copied into another array or object

3. React state: object inside a react component, that can start with an initial value and be altered

4. React props: arguments passed into react components, properties, read-only

5. DOM events: user-driven events that take place inside a web page: hovering over items, scrolling, clicking
